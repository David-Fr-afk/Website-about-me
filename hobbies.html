        <h3>Going to the gym <img src="workingout.png" alt = "dumbells" id = "dumbells" width ="115" height = "115"> </h3>
        <p>One thing that has become a daily activity is going to the gym. I personally love being there, pushing myself, learning new things, and achieving long time strength goals.</p>

        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>One thing I never expected, was my new found love for coding. I love the trial and error moments, I love learning new syntax and overall just coding things im passionate about. I wish I could dedicate more time to coding, but due to my second year classes taking a huge hit on my free time, I find myself scavenging for free time often to code. Usually when I code I like to thing big, then simply my problems, alot of times my creativty out works my expertise.</p>

        <h3>Being with my family</h3>
        <p>Something I never take for granted is having a family. I love my family, and even if they annoy me I love spending time with them. There is something so sweet about knowing you have people who truly love you around you at all times. Its extremely comforting to me.</p>
